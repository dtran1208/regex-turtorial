## Introduction to Regex

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools used in programming for matching patterns in strings.

## Component 1: Literal Characters 'a' and 'd'

In our regex `/a(b|c)d{2,3}/`, 'a' and 'd' are literal characters. They match exactly the characters 'a' and 'd'.

## Component 2: Group and Alternation '(b|c)'

The pattern '(b|c)' is a group that matches either 'b' or 'c'. The '|' character represents alternation, similar to 'OR' in logic.

## Component 3: Quantifier '{2,3}'

The quantifier `{2,3}` in our regex is used to match the preceding character ('d' in our case) 2 to 3 times.
